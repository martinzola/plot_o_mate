python ../../plot_o_mate.py binding_with_SD.txt -pn "binding_with_std_err" -pt 'Energy data with standard deviation'  -pl "Energy" -x "Distance Å" -y "Energy (kcal mol⁻¹)" -x_low 0.24 -y_low -3.5 -y_high 3 -lc "#34a0a4" -sd 2 

### The following command will produce a plot for a data file with 2 columns, with the first column as x-axis and the second column as y-axis. 
### Here, the standard deviation of the data is plotted alongside the raw data as a transparent band indicating the uncertainty in the data.
### The additional commands are explained below:
### -pn: The plot name. This is the name of the plot that is used to save the plot file.
### -x: The label for the x-axis.
### -y: The label for the y-axis.
### -pl: The plot label for the y-data. This is the label that is displayed for the line in the legend.
### -pt: The plot title.
### -ls: The line style for the plot.
### -lc: The line color for the plot.
### -y_high: The upper limit for the y-axis.
### -y_low: The lower limit for the y-axis.
### -sd: The index of the column containing the standard deviation data. This is used to plot the standard deviation as a transparent band around the data.
