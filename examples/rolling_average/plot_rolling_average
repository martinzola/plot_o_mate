### The following command will produce a plot for a data file with 2 columns, with the first column as x-axis and the second column as y-axis. 
### Here, the rolling average of the data is plotted alongside the raw data.
### The rolling average is calculated over a window of 100 data points.
### The additional commands are explained below:
### -pn: The plot name. This is the name of the plot that is used to save the plot file.
### -x: The label for the x-axis.
### -y: The label for the y-axis.
### -pl: The plot label for the y-data. This is the label that is displayed for the line in the legend.
### -pt: The plot title.
### -ls: The line style for the plot.
### -lc: The line color for the plot.
### -y_high: The upper limit for the y-axis.
### -y_low: The lower limit for the y-axis.
### -ra: The window size for the rolling average.
### -fc: The factor by which the y-axis values should be multiplied. This is useful for converting the y-axis values to a different unit.
### -fx: The factor by which the x-axis values should be multiplied. This is useful for converting the x-axis values to a different unit.
